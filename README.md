### Content Structure Convention
- **CRITICAL**: All pages must follow the standard content structure order:
  1. **Main content** - The primary article/tutorial content
  2. **Call-to-Action (CTA)** - Engagement section encouraging reader action
  3. **Source Reference** - Attribution or source links for the content
  4. **Related Content** - Cross-links to other relevant pages

This structure ensures consistent user experience and proper content flow across all pages. The source reference is positioned between the CTA and related content to maintain engagement flow while providing proper attribution before content discovery.
